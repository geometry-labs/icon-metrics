Off chain indexer for the ICON Blockchain serving **metrics** for the [icon-explorer](https://github.com/geometry-labs/icon-explorer). Service is broken up into API and worker components that are run as individual docker containers. Events are derived from various bespoke JSON RPC / REST calls against the nodes across the ecosystem and persisted in a postgres database.

### Endpoints

TODO: Links and table

### Deployment

Service can be run in the following ways:

1. Independently from this repo with docker compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml -f docker-compose.yml up -d
# Or alternatively
make up
```

2. With the whole stack from the main [icon-explorer]() repo.

3. With the helm chart.

**Please note this is for advanced users who are capable of setting external DBs / Strimzi and configuring them properly.**

TODO:

```bash
helm add
helm install
```

Run `make help` for more options.

### Development
